## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### MVVM Pattern
- **Model**: `CarItem` entity with business logic
- **View**: Jetpack Compose screens and components
- **ViewModel**: `CarViewModel` managing UI state

### Design Patterns Used
1. **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access abstraction
2. **Singleton Pattern**: Single database instance
3. **Observer Pattern**: Flow/StateFlow for reactive updates
4. **Factory Pattern**: Database builder pattern
5. **Strategy Pattern**: Sort and filter strategies

### OOP Principles Applied
- **Encapsulation**: Data and validation in sealed units
- **Abstraction**: Repository and DAO interfaces
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one purpose
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear layer boundaries
- **Composition**: UI built from composable components
- **Immutability**: Data classes with val properties

## 📊 Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE car_items (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    brand TEXT NOT NULL,
    model TEXT NOT NULL,
    year INTEGER NOT NULL,
    color TEXT NOT NULL,
    license_plate TEXT NOT NULL,
    daily_rate REAL NOT NULL,
    is_rented INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    notes TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''
);
```

**Indexes**: Primary key on `id`, sortable by all fields
**Queries**: 15+ pre-defined queries including aggregations

## 🎨 UI/UX Design

### Color Palette (Dark Blue Theme)
```kotlin
Primary Blue:    #1565C0
Dark Blue:       #0D47A1
Light Blue:      #42A5F5
Accent Orange:   #FF9800
Dark Gray:       #263238
Success Green:   #4CAF50
Error Red:       #F44336
